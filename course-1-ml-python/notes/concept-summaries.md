# Machine Learning 
Computer's ability to learn without explicitly programmed

## Learning techniques

### 1. Regression / Estimation
- **Definition**: Predicting continuous values.
- **Examples**:
  - House value prediction
  - CO₂ emission from a vehicle

### 2. Classification
- **Definition**: Categorizing data into classes or groups.
- **Examples**:
  - Spam detection in emails
  - Diagnosing diseases based on symptoms

### 3. Clustering
- **Definition**: Grouping data into clusters based on similarity without labeled data.
- **Examples**:
  - Customer segmentation
  - Image compression by grouping similar colors

### 4. Association
- **Definition**: Discovering relationships or patterns between variables in a dataset.
- **Examples**:
  - Market basket analysis (e.g., identifying products frequently bought together)
  - Recommendation systems

### 5. Anomaly Detection
- **Definition**: Identifying unusual patterns or outliers in data that do not conform to expected behavior.
- **Examples**:
  - Fraud detection in banking
  - Identifying defects in manufacturing processes

### 6. Sequence Mining
- **Definition**: Discovering sequences or patterns in data that follow a specific order.
- **Examples**:
  - Analyzing customer purchase sequences
  - DNA sequence analysis for biological research

### 7. Dimensionality Reduction
- **Definition**: Reducing the number of features or dimensions in a dataset while retaining significant information.
- **Examples**:
  - Compressing image data for faster processing
  - Simplifying complex datasets in medical or financial analyses

### 8. Recommendation Systems
- **Definition**: Providing personalized suggestions to users based on preferences, behaviors, or patterns.
- **Examples**:
  - Movie recommendations on streaming platforms
  - Product suggestions in e-commerce

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Definition**: Cleaning and preparing your raw data to make it suitable for model training.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Fixing missing values
  - Removing duplicates
  - Converting text to numerical data
- **Importance**: Ensures data quality, which is crucial for accurate model performance.

### 2. Train/Test Split
- **Definition**: Dividing your data into two parts: one to teach the model (training set) and one to evaluate how well it learned (testing set).
- **Purpose**: Helps in assessing the model's performance on unseen data, preventing overfitting.

### 3. Algorithm Setup
- **Definition**: Selecting and configuring the right type of machine learning model for your specific problem.
- **Examples**:
  - Linear Regression for predicting continuous values
  - Decision Trees for classification tasks
- **Importance**: Choosing the right algorithm is essential for solving different types of problems effectively.

### 4. Model Fitting
- **Definition**: Training your chosen model using the training data to learn patterns and relationships.
- **Analogy**: Similar to teaching a student with practice problems.
- **Outcome**: A trained model that can make predictions on new data.

### 5. Prediction
- **Definition**: Using your trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.
- **Purpose**: Apply the model’s learned knowledge to produce outputs based on new inputs.

### 6. Evaluation
- **Definition**: Measuring how accurate your model's predictions are by comparing them to actual outcomes.
- **Common Metrics**:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall for classification
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression
- **Importance**: Provides insights into the model’s performance and highlights areas for improvement.

### 7. Model Export
- **Definition**: Saving your trained model so you can use it later without re-training
