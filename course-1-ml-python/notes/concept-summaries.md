# Machine Learning 
Computer's ability to learn without explicitly programmed

## Learning techniques

## 1. Regression / Estimation
- **Definition**: Predicting continuous values.
- **Examples**:
  - House value prediction
  - CO₂ emission from a vehicle

## 2. Classification
- **Definition**: Categorizing data into classes or groups.
- **Examples**:
  - Spam detection in emails
  - Diagnosing diseases based on symptoms

## 3. Clustering
- **Definition**: Grouping data into clusters based on similarity without labeled data.
- **Examples**:
  - Customer segmentation
  - Image compression by grouping similar colors

## 4. Association
- **Definition**: Discovering relationships or patterns between variables in a dataset.
- **Examples**:
  - Market basket analysis (e.g., identifying products frequently bought together)
  - Recommendation systems

## 5. Anomaly Detection
- **Definition**: Identifying unusual patterns or outliers in data that do not conform to expected behavior.
- **Examples**:
  - Fraud detection in banking
  - Identifying defects in manufacturing processes

## 6. Sequence Mining
- **Definition**: Discovering sequences or patterns in data that follow a specific order.
- **Examples**:
  - Analyzing customer purchase sequences
  - DNA sequence analysis for biological research

## 7. Dimensionality Reduction
- **Definition**: Reducing the number of features or dimensions in a dataset while retaining significant information.
- **Examples**:
  - Compressing image data for faster processing
  - Simplifying complex datasets in medical or financial analyses

## 8. Recommendation Systems
- **Definition**: Providing personalized suggestions to users based on preferences, behaviors, or patterns.
- **Examples**:
  - Movie recommendations on streaming platforms
  - Product suggestions in e-commerce
